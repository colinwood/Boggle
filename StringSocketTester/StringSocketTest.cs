                    {{nihongo|'''Kirby'''|????|Kabi}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the protagonist of the 
                    ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby series]]'' of video games owned by [[Nintendo]]. As one of Nintendo's most famous and familiar icons, 
                    Kirby's round, pink appearance and ability to copy his foe's powers to use as his own has made him a well known figure in video 
                    games, consistently ranked as one of the most iconic video game characters. He made his first appearance in 1992 in ''[[Kirby's 
                    Dream Land]]'' for the [[Game Boy]]. Originally a placeholder, created by [[Masahiro Sakurai]], for the game's early development, 
                    he has since then starred in over 20 games, ranging from [[Action game|action]] [[Platform game|platformers]] to [[Kirby's Pinball
                    Land|pinball]], [[Puzzle game|puzzle]] and [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]] games, and has been featured as a playable fighter in all 
                    ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' games. He has also starred in his own [[Kirby: Right Back at Ya|anime]] and manga series. His most 
                    recent appearance is in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'', released in 2014 for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Wii 
                    U]]. Since 1999, he has been voiced by [[Makiko Ohmoto]].
                    Kirby is famous for his ability to inhale objects and creatures to obtain their attributes, as well as his ability to float with 
`                   puffed cheeks. He uses these abilities to rescue various lands, such as his home world of Dream Land, from evil forces and 
                    antagonists, such as [[Dark Matter (Kirby)|Dark Matter]] or [[Nightmare (Kirby)|Nightmare]]. On these adventures he often crosses 
                    paths with his rivals, the gluttonous [[King Dedede]] and the mysterious [[Meta Knight]]. In virtually all his appearances,
                    Kirby is depicted as cheerful, innocent, and food loving but becomes fearless, bold, and brave in the face of danger.
